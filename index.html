            <p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b style="font-size: 150%;">C</b>ommunication is defined as <b>the giving, receiving</b>, or exchanging of information, opinions, <b>or ideas so that the message is completely understood by everybody involved.</b> A two-way process, communication comprises the following elements a the sender, message, channel, receiver, feedback, and context.</p>

            <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 1.2em;">So now, Let's get started with the three theories that we will be exploring!</p>

                <h2>Agenda Setting Theory</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><b style="font-size: 150%;">T</b>he issuance setting, also known as the agenda-setting, is the theory of communication and belongs to a propagation effect. The topic is set to emphasize a topic through the direction and quantity of the mass media. The topics that are emphasized in the media have a significant association with important issues known in the minds of the audience, while the media has an important impact on this process. The more media reports, the more important the masses will feel.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-4 p-5" style="background-color: #F7ECDE;">
                <h2>Framing Theory</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><b style="font-size: 150%;">T</b>he concept of framing is related to the agenda-setting tradition but expands the research by focusing on the essence of the issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. The basis of framing theory is that the media focuses attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12 col-md-4 p-5" style="background-color: #E9DAC1;">
                <h2>Spiral of Silence Theory</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><b style="font-size: 150%;">T</b>he spiral of silence theory is a political science and mass communication theory proposed by the German political scientist Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann. It states that an individual's perception of the distribution of public opinion influences that individual's willingness to express their own political opinions.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-7 border border-dark p-5">
                <h2>Similarities</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><b style="font-size: 150%;">F</b>irst, the common similarity is that they are all communication theories, that goes without saying.<br><br>
                    What's more, there is a causal relationship between these three theories. If agenda-setting describes how the public accessibility of a problem is affected by how much the media cover that problem, frame-setting describes how public perceptions of what is applicable to explaining a
                    problem are influenced by how the media frame that problem (Price & Tewksbury, 1997). <br><br>
                    And it is because the public is influenced by the media thinking, or they have been implied which things are important, so when the discussing some sensitive issues, people who hold minority views fear that their proposals will not be accepted by the public, so they will be selectively silent or even forced to agree with the public against their will, which will gradually erase the diversity of voices, which is not a good thing. The progress of history is inseparable from questioning, and it is because of the existence of questioning that the collision of ideas will result in a more excellent product.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-5 p-5" style="background-color: #202020; color: #ffffff;">
                <h2>Diffenerces</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><b style="font-size: 150%;">I</b>t is also very easy to distinguish the differences between these three theories. First of all, agenda-setting is an initiation for the other two theories, in which causality can be both a similarity but also a difference. While agenda setting focuses on the media's efforts to identify issues (agendas) for discussion in the public sphere, the framework can be further developed by identifying not only what audiences should think about these issues, but also how they should think about them. As for the spiral of silence, although it is a story about the willingness of individuals to be told, it is only the result of the final manifestation, in which the process or the process that drives its eventual outcome cannot be separated from agenda-setting and framing by media.</p>
